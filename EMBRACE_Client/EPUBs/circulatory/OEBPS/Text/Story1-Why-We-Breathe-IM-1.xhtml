    <p class="sentence" id="s1">Why do we breathe?</p>

    <p class="sentence" id="s2">The air we breathe has different types of molecules.</p>

    <p class="sentence" id="s3">Oxygen molecules look like two red balls. Each molecule has two atoms of oxygen.</p>

    <p class="sentence" id="s4">Carbon dioxide molecules looks like a black ball between two red balls. There is one black carbon atom and two red oxygen atoms.</p>

    <p class="sentence actionSentence" id="s5">When we breathe in, oxygen in the air goes into the nose.</p>

    <p class="sentence actionSentence" id="s6">Then the oxygen goes into the lungs.</p>

    <p class="sentence" id="s7">There are little tubes in the lungs called arteries, and there is blood in the arteries.</p>

    <p class="sentence actionSentence" id="s8">Carbon dioxide from the blood goes into the lungs.</p>

    <p class="sentence actionSentence" id="s9">When we breathe out, the carbon dioxide goes into the air.</p>

    <p class="sentence actionSentence" id="s10">At the same time, the oxygen goes into the blood.</p>

    <p class="sentence actionSentence" id="s11">The blood with oxygen goes back to the heart.</p>

    <p class="sentence" id="s12">Breathing is how we get oxygen into the blood and move carbon dioxide into the air.</p>

    <p class="sentence" id="s13">The oxygen helps to turn food into energy so that we can live.</p>
