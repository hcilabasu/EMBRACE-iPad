1890120|c74148fdcfbf314935e29e72e312f6ac.mp3|On top of a hill which overlooked a beautiful river, there lived a young boy whose name was Lucas.
1890121|35df2c5501ffa2eadac480b71f194a31.mp3|Like most afternoons, the boy walked down the hill to watch the sun set over the river.
1890122|d33a411cd1a0cea3352ae8196b144755.mp3|But this time was special because Lucas found a bottle floating in the water.
1890123|5b5f2346a281c0cc9344474800839c9d.mp3|He picked it up and carried it home to give to his father.
1890124|080f3ccf1839b6d9aa28e40e82f3d6f6.mp3|\"What's this?\" Papa asked.
1890125|fe67a05149036b2fc917010322ec10ee.mp3|Papa opened the bottle to find out.
1890126|01fa735791ccaa74dd06413dcb46d451.mp3|Just then, a note wrapped around a stone fell out and tumbled across the floor.
1890127|e95f4792e41bb8703e39170d0bea4581.mp3|Papa picked up the note and read, \"He who finds this lucky stone will be granted three wishes!\"
1890128|d117fe2d20adac3fcd7e6057626b5844.mp3|\"That's me!\" yelled the boy.
1890129|e3e65709617083f946a0ad99d614b87f.mp3|Lucas picked up the stone and promised to make the best wishes.
1890130|3244f85296a389c83c38424144be165c.mp3|The next day, the boy went back to the river where he had found his lucky stone.
1890131|dda77ec1be0fc3be7a59607cd2fad8e2.mp3|He sat on the bench and thought about his wishes.
1890132|01b760b093f7e44a148a9567104f582f.mp3|What did he really want?
1890133|9e429f324594696054ce4c93fafb95b6.mp3|\"Ooh,\" he said, \"I want a room full of the best toys!\"
1890134|c4b182f66184bec7f668398ef7cfd97f.mp3|The next day, the boy went back to the river.
1890135|1fd5ffe145fecebfb803863a22170efd.mp3|He went to where he had found his lucky stone.
1890136|c1c91adbe42b46a3d9e1ef3f8bf4c7ec.mp3|While he sat on the bench, he thought about his wishes.
1890137|20cd79fdf44dbf3ff7904a01802ccd77.mp3|\"What do I really want,\" he thought.
1890138|afb2cfafb72106e1e6c07445bc6fac70.mp3|Later that day, the boy walked up to his room and found that the toys had magically appeared!
1890139|578de8829811325412b37c2da5338425.mp3|He could not wait to start playing with them.
1890140|2b692d8d9dcfb6c84c0a240eb895028d.mp3|Lucas picked up the ball, but soon realized that he needed someone to catch it.
1890141|d4b01964a504c2633443b1da3b208969.mp3|So, he put it back down.
1890142|75e24f4db7d97186c21185550fc332cf.mp3|Then, he opened the board-game instead.
1890143|cc0356e78797bc5c6c0b88aeaefd82ba.mp3|Once again, he needed somebody to play with.
1890144|e606648936d984b6da8ce65d29a6d1d4.mp3|Later that day, the boy walked up to his room.
1890145|c6015a9d81f8eb17704044d8210ffb38.mp3|He found that the toys had magically appeared.
1890146|49ddbfcef412593f110dea741ada12a4.mp3|Lucas picked up the ball.
1890147|e801dd0ed5a6c120acf559ae94e2887b.mp3|He soon realized that he needed someone to catch it.
1890148|3f48ae17f18410cc09fd63468603e4fc.mp3|When the boy walked up to his room later that day, he found that the toys had magically appeared.
1890149|dd7ae563fc31698e60103739b0573dcb.mp3|As Lucas picked up the ball, he realized that he needed someone to catch it.
1890150|27e879a131227b13533153792d0d2bec.mp3|So, he put it back down and opened the board-game instead.
1890151|4bc4c6bc98728c61b3047396f2acd684.mp3|Once again, he realized, he needed somebody to play with.
1890152|bb99ccd0fe8f31220278e36e5206cdd1.mp3|Lucas felt silly for making his first wish too quickly.
1890153|f1c3b87a7225955139cc79c49d4b81aa.mp3|He decided to think harder about his next one.
1890154|79540e66da27bdf6033e414687071101.mp3|All of this thinking made him sleepy, so he took a nap.
1890155|10382b956bb30e1b308435de1b07d091.mp3|When Lucas woke up, he knew exactly what to wish for!
1890156|c907c6dd7f1911815d9bc172f14123a6.mp3|He jumped out of bed and ran to tell Papa.
1890157|93ad6f165f5a24061662a249882ceb51.mp3|Lucas felt silly.
1890158|bb4dbda719ec64b00083cb0e12b47293.mp3|He made his first wish too quickly.
1890159|c7d4c6e72ce214acd23b91363a2b4c1a.mp3|All of this thinking made him sleepy.
1890160|f306b6d3ab0db3cf7af0c51c1175f5ec.mp3|He took a nap.
1890161|db2647009900179be22e1a673e47c2e3.mp3|Then Lucas woke up.
1890162|ee159ec2924a71fa622a320a975988f3.mp3|He knew exactly what to wish for!
1890163|3afae3a1642614f31c479955f041640a.mp3|He jumped out of bed. He ran to tell Papa.
1890164|8e2af48d04c3a089ad416525b8d47be4.mp3|After making his first wish too quickly, Lucas felt silly.
1890165|11fd061741740534d26a39b933646a29.mp3|So, he decided to think harder about his next one.
1890166|6b94daa6dad4273810d8b6286d2c7d8a.mp3|Because all this thinking made him sleepy, he took a nap.
1890167|2c2ba56e62d5ac0d53396bc4852c0938.mp3|After he jumped out of bed, he ran to tell Papa.
1890168|0c93744bbbbec7858f18cf0aa54846b0.mp3|\"Papa, Papa, I want a little brother!\" shouted Lucas.
1890169|739a733ea8ebb3c8ff851944e389ebd9.mp3|Papa told the boy to sit in the chair.
1890170|6968ea65890985938838fb795e0aad15.mp3|\"Son,\" he said, \"I have something very important to tell you: soon, you will have an adopted baby brother!\"
1890171|afec9935a39f5e63c1f7291f3be6dbae.mp3|Filled with excitement, Lucas ran circles around the room.
1890172|a7ada32436e529dd447a9c73a993a4b3.mp3|He said, \"Son, I have something very important to tell you.
1890173|21a757aa1f1c78ad66b56070e1fe4a46.mp3|Soon, you will have an adopted baby brother!\"
1890174|43367436044e7abe33dfff15b1307642.mp3|Lucas was filled with excitement.
1890175|99e5bbae2cc45249d60eb3bc493e442c.mp3|He ran circles around the room.
1890176|d4ee342a95f0e052426d69d4dcf9d034.mp3|Lucas shouted to his father that he wanted a little brother.
1890177|1c75b2fe8283efa4aaf96ea8787f1ee0.mp3|When the baby arrived, Lucas could not wait to play with him.
1890178|75e483472156d16d569cb4a8798e13e8.mp3|He carried his little brother up to his room.
1890179|d21543ef44dbdba7281937b02e60066b.mp3|Once again, he grabbed the ball.
1890180|bcc850d103ec1873f3a46ade32e727b3.mp3|This time, he threw it to his brother, but it flew right past him.
1890181|226ddc0297e73f14488c86a0bd43970c.mp3|Then, Lucas opened the board-game, but the baby just stared at it.
1890182|7eb488a1ea2c071718fa117c30907a9c.mp3|That is when Lucas realized that his brother was too young to play with these toys.
1890183|65edc71e52452f71cbc7c85740a94023.mp3|Lucas went to ask Papa for advice because he was no longer happy with his little brother.
1890184|d0436bdaa019cf8cf5fea90b6a180661.mp3|He only had one wish left!
1890185|0fd03dc7038235727c98167a967f66fe.mp3|He grabbed the ball.
1890186|9fcb108b3dbc8d9f58d4b4a64b0dfd5d.mp3|This time, he threw it to his brother.
1890187|cbc7c34f694d6221897da482095deb6d.mp3|But the ball flew right past him.
1890188|30a05e937ae462bc624f20becfb032ec.mp3|Then, Lucas opened the board-game.
1890189|09838ca11be8ddd756f865762cc0443f.mp3|The baby just stared at it.
1890190|b1312c0335e3e632556e0fa88de95329.mp3|Lucas went to ask Papa for advice.
1890191|d6b37f14fd24af55b480e9c383acc442.mp3|He was no longer happy with his little brother.
1890192|fa8bcc0ed5d73298eb62abe8a507456f.mp3|So, he carried his little brother up to his room.
1890193|579e1ec6e094e8eb8bc8cf9b8a33aa0b.mp3|This time, when he threw it to his brother, the ball flew right past him.
1890194|68b1f261fc0b0bf13bc8debd50b2f623.mp3|No longer happy with his little brother, and with only one wish left, Lucas went to ask Papa for advice.
1890195|251c68fabcc5d88fed9283bead4addf5.mp3|\"Follow me,\" said Papa as he walked down the hill while carrying the baby.
1890196|683ed80fa12d08f90eb17eddcec16b80.mp3|\"See the river,\" he continued. \"Its happiness does not come from things or wishes. Instead, its joy comes from within.\"
1890197|64aa9ec20c008a51710f3bdc4686ed5b.mp3|Lucas understood and tossed the bottle and stone back into the water.
1890198|88a0a0a3429be85cfd74fe72ee7ee0fd.mp3|\"I do not need my last wish to be happy,\" he thought.
1890199|b1e64ff3cff5786d815c7b791bbd8094.mp3|\"Follow me,\" said Papa.
1890200|0a2751df1e07f309c3379421f3f63a4f.mp3|He walked down the hill while carrying the baby.
1890201|8af33e75de26b1f1f0ad71722dccd865.mp3|Papa continued, \"See the river.

1890204|a0dd47e0b13bc86415af2d9e17b4e7b9.mp3|Lucas understood.
1890205|2befa4a815217bea7dfeef00d093b09e.mp3|He tossed the bottle and stone back into the water.
1890206|eede19facb55771c83823a9e4cd82d44.mp3|His papa told him to follow him as he walked down the hill while carrying the baby.
1890207|82f960a6bd8c785c3e9bf72e54545b2e.mp3|When Lucas understood, he tossed the bottle and stone back into the water.
1890208|70b3de7655f4a4eb740251232747ca19.mp3|Papa filled a cup with water from the river.
1890209|6fd1a5067e4663b15d2d65cecd9803f2.mp3|He told the boy one last thing: \"By sharing its water, the river helps others, and that brings it joy.\"
1890210|6ea1be348b74a6e1c3e1e1fc5435840c.mp3|The boy gave Papa a hug and said, \"Thank you for your words of wisdom. I am so lucky to have a dad like you!\"
1890211|5d3581071e6af5e1a4955dde23e727b9.mp3|Lucas picked up his brother and went back to the house to play.
1890212|5eda0a7346ba28622dbcd8a43aaaa285.mp3|The boy gave Papa a hug.
1890213|c57f6ec35056d45f787f6729c8f315b1.mp3|He said, \"Thank you for your words of wisdom. I am so lucky to have a dad like you!\"
1890214|5e6ff106350e1cc8a6c482431a8adf07.mp3|Lucas picked up his brother.
1890215|f99c7846e5aa30be60acfc1e538341ff.mp3|He went back to the house to play.

1890218|5c7e52b18413420b98996e4cf88492b0.mp3|Lucas picked up his brother so they could go back to the house to play.
1890219|57ffc7ee983faaf99bf8d983ab583bcb.mp3|This time, he grabbed the rattle from the green chair and gave it to the baby.
1890220|42661417c56a590dbb11ec3a02f109e0.mp3|Lucas had decided to make the baby happy instead of himself.
1890221|fc8dcc51e2030bbd6fa19337c73fdf6d.mp3|When he heard his brother giggle, Lucas became very happy, too!
1890222|a7a05c6c6bdaae79ec7969ba87c26a9d.mp3|He grabbed the rattle from the green chair. Then he gave it to the baby.
1890223|8cf7ebe9f3a7ecd23219bbd67881084b.mp3|He heard his brother giggle.
1890224|2badfd409966a74e87acaa6c2621cab6.mp3|Lucas became very happy too!
1890225|b2dd838528814c1e9ead85f281b8e0fc.mp3|A few days later, as usual, Lucas took a stroll along the river while playing with his ball.
1890226|69a20a00404802e1da838ace90ce3843.mp3|He was relieved to see that the bottle and stone were out of sight.
1890227|5445eaa54bd9eb612c908465b4ca9d3e.mp3|All of a sudden, a young girl crossed his path.
1890228|b845cb14244b54ae8ba1e97f655772ea.mp3|\"Hi, I'm Olivia! I live just on the other side of that hill,\" she said.
1890229|119781d5f276b5e9dad83ae5278998f6.mp3|He noticed that the girl had something in her hand.
1890230|f55a694b6f5e445ea537273d9b9c6283.mp3|A few days later, Lucas took a stroll along the river.
1890231|60ef64b26d012060a659247173b366bf.mp3|He was playing with his ball.
1890232|5406153eaaa402f9dc92866d7498b8ef.mp3|When he saw that the bottle and stone were out of sight, he was relieved.
1890233|247d1450799423e54ec6b9e0204ce0b7.mp3|Just then, he noticed that the girl had something in her hand.
1890234|dbecfe7365d82e532b1fb28177030488.mp3|Lucas asked Olivia what she was holding, but she replied, \"Nothing!\" Then she threw the bottle behind the bush to hide it.
1890235|9e6be172d7d6e7b9f50550a709e49d54.mp3|\"I don't want to take your wish, Olivia.
1890236|57ca20f4252f5e92286261d4e4d0eb28.mp3|Can we just be friends?\" asked the boy while picking up the bottle and handing it to her.
1890237|6de29bb22c2a74907a7bb17de669955d.mp3|\"What are you holding?\" asked Lucas.
1890238|d4b38d851ef61c81dbe27df7d8433485.mp3|Olivia replied, \"Nothing!\" Then she threw the bottle behind the bush to hide it.

1890244|ecbb85095b9bf034dd67b20344982591.mp3|\"Catch!\" Lucas yelled as he threw her the ball.
1890245|37cae7abcdb25749e76fc4eed6513081.mp3|From that day forward, the two friends were always together.
1890246|da59f2014155f0909daa8388e190ef8d.mp3|By treating others with kindness and finding joy within himself, Lucas got exactly what he needed: someone to catch the ball.
1890247|d410159e0cb93e45f5ec24ea4b85dc2c.mp3|\"Catch!\" Lucas yelled.
1890248|ce1cd5bb39eeff35b269a65781755878.mp3|He threw her the ball.
1890249|c07ea0f2462f59e61e77b5b6ea6021cf.mp3|Olivia said that she would love to be friends and that she didn't need a wish anymore.
