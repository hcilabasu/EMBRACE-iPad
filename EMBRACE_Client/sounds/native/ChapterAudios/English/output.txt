1891231|bef140a888b3615bbde274b36d8b07dd.mp3|Many Navajos live in modern houses, but nearby they often have a hogan used for ceremonies.
1891232|374ba67d257ccfdcafdb0728306df347.mp3|Sometimes the hogan is round, sometimes square, and sometimes it is an octagon with eight sides.
1891233|1789a1604436a571169d906dde02e2ae.mp3|The frame of a hogan is made from tree branches.
1891234|b2f8f821b35d570cc3def4e55d76d7e5.mp3|The spaces between the branches are filled with mud.
1891235|4b130eedc43740b6c2e23dabd55a02f8.mp3|Instead of a door, sometimes the entryway is covered with a blanket to keep the wind and cold out.
1891236|9711430c698fec66298329d28875e4e3.mp3|The sun rises in the east.
1891237|54bce8bb7e36086efbb07431aab367e8.mp3| The entryway faces east to receive the morning light.
1891238|37edc2dbb9c4878f804ab03ff12ccd48.mp3|Inside, a blanket is hung from the middle of the ceiling to create two rooms.
1891239|7f0970ab6c3ea52156bb452d1a1476aa.mp3|The men always sit on the left, and the women sit on the right.
1891240|27d146558af1f7be2566f52651b657b2.mp3|Thus, hogans provide Navajo people with shelter and places for important family events.

1891273|38d6508c6084c37292890e5825cc084f.mp3|They also used the skins to make teepees, which are similar to tents.
1891274|e8d52c6ccb602775881ecd02c749737c.mp3|Because the buffalo moved across many miles, the Sioux needed to move their teepees, too.
1891275|572919f7d957293e66916a1a9de6e4dc.mp3|First, they took the teepee apart and wrapped it up.

1891290|a0e41c200d2dca23ea740b7878319477.mp3|Then the Sioux stood the three poles upright to make a frame for the teepee.
1891291|8b6ee0be6beae3e91a4f65a66a212672.mp3|The Sioux added more poles to make the frame rounder.
